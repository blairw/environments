## Why?

- Debian is too hard to install
- Ubuntu is bloated these days; and _still_ integrates with Amazon
- Arch is brilliant but unstable; ditto even Antergos
- CentOS is too far behind the release curve

## MATE

- GNOME is great but too heavy + chunky
- MATE is fast
- Just use [MATE-Compiz install file](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/mate-compiz/).

## Basic installation

```
sudo dnf install -y \
    audacity \
    geany \
    geary \
    gimp \
    git \
    gitg \
    gparted \
    libreoffice \
    MyPasswordSafe \
    numix-icon-theme-circle \
    p7zip \
    redshift
```
